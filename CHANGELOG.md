## v4.0.0

### Breaking changes

* Removed the settings «Chats are only available for local videos». From now on, webchat can only be activated for local videos. It will never be displayed on remote videos. This is because an incompatibility with a new feature (webchat per channel). Moreover this feature was very limited: the webchat was not shared with the remote instance (this will probably be achieved in a future release).

### Features

* Possibility to have webchat per channel (see [this request](https://github.com/JohnXLivingston/peertube-plugin-livechat/issues/58))
  * Builtin Prosody: instance's admins can choose if rooms are per video, or grouped by channel. Only one settings for the whole instance.

  * External webchat tool: new placeholder CHANNEL_ID in the webchat url.

### Fixes

* Builtin Prosody: Fix [#63](https://github.com/JohnXLivingston/peertube-plugin-livechat/issues/63). On some old Peertube installations, there can be usernames with upper-case letters. Adding a toLowerCase() for the XMPP jid.
